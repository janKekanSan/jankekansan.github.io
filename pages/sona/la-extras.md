## Comparisons with la

Back in the [prepositions lesson](./preps.html), we learned several ways to make comparisons using [tawa]{.tokipona} and [sama]{.tokipona}! [la]{.tokipona}, especially with a phrase, gives us a few more useful comparisons!

<details><summary> [tomo la tomo ni li lili]{.tokipona} </summary>

This house is small compared to other houses.

In the context of buildings, this building is tiny.

To other rooms, this room is too little!

::: info

Here's a restatement that uses [tawa]{.tokipona}:

[tomo ni li lili tawa tomo **ante**]{.tokipona}

With this restatement, it helps to include the modifier [ante]{.tokipona} for clarity. That modifier can help the original too!

</details>

This works very similarly to [tawa]{.tokipona}, too. Check under the spoiler!

Many comparisons with [la]{.tokipona} boil down to working like [tawa]{.tokipona}. You can find more examples of that [here](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/Comparisons)!

[I also have a video lesson dedicated to comparisons!](https://youtu.be/_li6QeNoek0)
It's on the older side, before I fancied up my process, editing, and avatar, but the knowledge is just as good!

## Breaking up your sentences

Remember this long example from the main lesson?

> [jan li alasa e kiwen wawa lon tenpo suno ale la ona li pakala e ilo mute li kama wile pali ala]{.tokipona}

You can restate this long sentence as two shorter ones, too:

> [jan li alasa e kiwen wawa lon tenpo suno ale. ni la ona li pakala e ilo mute li kama wile pali ala]{.tokipona}

The trick here is that it's almost the same- the sentence that was originally before [la]{.tokipona} now ends where [la]{.tokipona} was. Then the second sentence begins with ["ni la"]{.tokipona}, connecting the previous sentence to this new one! This makes the same relationship between the two sentences.

## Avoiding a 2nd pi

Remember way back in the [modifiers lesson](./mod-pi.html) when we learned about [pi]{.tokipona} and using only one at a time? If you've been practicing since then, you might have noticed that two [pi]{.tokipona} phrases can be hard to avoid sometimes. But [la]{.tokipona} can help!

Take the following sentence for example:

<details><summary>[pali lipu pi jan pi pana sona li wawa]{.tokipona}</summary>

The work of the teacher's book is amazing!

</details>

This is grammatical, but it's a bit messy with two [pi]{.tokipona} phrases! What if we put [jan pi pana sona]{.tokipona} into context, instead of the main sentence?

<details><summary>[jan pi pana sona la pali pi lipu ona li wawa]{.tokipona}</summary>

The work of the teacher's book is amazing.

In the context of the teacher, the work of their book is amazing.

</details>

In general, you can put statements in the context and refer back to them with [ona]{.tokipona} and [ni]{.tokipona}. This can help your sentences flow differently, fix your grammar, or just be a fun way to speak!

<!-- <details><summary>[jan pi pana sona li jo e lipu. lipu li jo e pali. pali lipu li wawa.]{.tokipona}</summary> -->
<!---->
<!-- The teacher has a book. The book has work. The work of the book is a lot. -->
<!---->
<!-- </details> -->
<!---->
<!-- And this cleans up the grammar! But it's still really wordy, so let's get clever: -->
<!---->
<!-- <details><summary>[jan pi pana sona li jo e lipu. pali lipu li wawa.]{.tokipona}</summary> -->
<!---->
<!-- The teacher has a book. The book's work is difficult. -->
<!---->
<!-- </details> -->
<!---->
<!-- Here, we skip introducing the idea of the [lipu]{.tokipona} having [pali]{.tokipona}, and instead just imply it. Nice! But can we do better? -->
<!---->
<!-- <details><summary>[jan pi pana sona la pali pi lipu ona li wawa]{.tokipona}</summary> -->
<!-- </details> -->

<!-- In short: You can put a phrase in [la]{.tokipona}, then refer to it later with [ona]{.tokipona} or [ni]{.tokipona}. -->

<!-- <details><summary> See the various interpretations! </summary> -->
<!---->
<!-- - The work of the teacher's book is so much! -->
<!-- - The teacher has a book. The book has work. The work of the book is a lot. -->
<!-- - The teacher's book has a lot of complex work! -->
<!---->
<!-- </details> -->

## Implying an object

We noted through the [main [la]{.tokipona} lesson](./la.html) that [la]{.tokipona} phrases can stand in for other prepositions and grammatical functions. What if it stood in for an even more important word- [e]{.tokipona}?

One of the coolest ways to use [la]{.tokipona} is to imply a specific object- a specific word or phrase being interacted with.

<!-- TODO: different than pana -->

> ko la kasi li pana

This isn't guaranteed to be understood, but it is possible for this statement to mean the same as the following:

> kasi li pana e ko

You can even use this to imply multiple objects for a single part of speech, such as for [e]{.tokipona}:

<details><summary> [kiwen mani en ko pi kon pona la mi pana tawa ona]{.tokipona} </summary>

I gave silver and incense to them.

</details>

Restatements such as these aren't strictly necessary- in this case, you can just use [e]{.tokipona} twice:

> [mi pana e kiwen mani e ko pi kon pona tawa ona]{.tokipona}

But this multiple object trick can also work for prepositions, where it's much more useful! Here is is for [lon]{.tokipona}:

<details><summary> [ma tomo en telo suli la mi lon poka]{.tokipona} </summary>

I am near the city and the ocean!

</details>

The closest restatements are a bit more clumsy, grammatically:

> [mi lon poka pi ma pomo pi telo suli]{.tokipona}

> [mi lon poka pi ijo tu: ma tomo en telo suli]{.tokipona}

These are still valid though!
